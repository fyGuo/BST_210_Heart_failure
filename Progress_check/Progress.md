# Week 4

## FG: Statistical analysis plan

1. Descripiton of the data
  - Sample size and any missing data 
  - Final sample size
  - Descriptive analys: t-test or chisq-test
  - Treating expusre as a continuous or a categorical variable or both.
2. Regression plan
  - Cox Proportional Hazard model.
  - Strata by what
  - Modificiation
  - Splines

3. Sensitivity analysis
  - Any missing data problem.
  - Measreument error.

## Jinglun Li

1. Introduction part: determine which exposure we should use use. Exposure should has a biological meaning in this study. 
2. Maybe a chart like biological mechanism maybe helpful.
3. Simply describing the background of our outcome. 

## Xinhao Li

1. Sample size and any missing data 
2. Final sample size
3. Descriptive analys: t-test or chisq-test (make a table 1 like )
4. Histogram or boxplot of exposure. 
5. Distribution of time for our outcome.
6. A table can like this  

|                     |1st Quintile| 2nd Quintile| 3rd Quintile| 4th Quintile| 5th Quintile|
|--                   |------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Exposure (continious)| Mean (sd)  |             |             |             |             |
|Failure time average |Mean (sd)   |             |             |             |             |
| Age                 |            |             |             |             |             |
